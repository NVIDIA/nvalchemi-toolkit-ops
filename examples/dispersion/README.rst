Interactions
============

Examples demonstrating GPU-accelerated computation of atomic interactions,
including DFT-D3 dispersion corrections with environment-dependent C6 coefficients.

These examples show how to:

* Compute dispersion energies and forces for molecules
* Process batches of crystal structures
* Integrate with PyTorch for differentiable workflows
